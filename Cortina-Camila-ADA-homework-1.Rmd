##Challenge 1
```{r}
quote<- as.vector("There grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved")
quote<- gsub("[[:punct:]]","", quote)

split_quote<- str_split(quote, " ")
split_quote<- split_quote[[1]]
split_quote

every_fourth<- split_quote[seq(from = 1, to = length(split_quote), by = 4)]
every_fourth

every_fourth<- sort(every_fourth, decreasing = TRUE)
every_fourth
```

##Challenge 2
```{r}
m1<- matrix(data = seq(from = 1, to = 159, by = 2), nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)
m1

m1[5,2]

m1[5:7,]

m2<- m1[3:6, 4:9]
m2

class(m2) #The class of m2 is a matrix
mode(m2) #The mode of m2 is numeric 
```

##Challenge 3
```{r}
a<- array(data = 400:1, dim = c(5, 5, 4, 4))
a

a[1,1,1,2] #Returns a single number within the array
a[2,3,2,] #Returns all of the numbers found at the second row third column of the second matrix within each array
a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3] #Returns the third matrix in the third array
```

##Challenge 4
```{r}
